# TasksToDo

The idea for this app was to create a fun and engaging way to play with friends at my girlfriend's birthday party.

On Sunday evening, while planning the party, we realized how difficult it always is to collect photos from events and how frustrating it is to only have them from our own perspective.

That’s when I had the idea: I could create an app where everyone could post their images, forming a collective gallery. People attending the party would receive a link leading to a site with tasks. These tasks could be completed by submitting an image or video to the app, which would then be stored in a database and displayed in the gallery.

I came up with this idea four days before the party and started working on the project the very next day. With only three evenings to build the app, I decided to use Firebase Storage and Firestore as a quick and efficient way to handle image storage and other data.

Since I’m used to coding with React, it was the natural choice for me. Due to the limited time, I opted for MUI libraries to quickly create A user-friendly UI and smooth UX for the app.

Despite the short timeframe, I created a decent app and received a lot of positive feedback. Next, I plan to fix the vulnerabilities I didn’t have time to address and rebuild the app using Flutter.

Thank you for reading, and enjoy the code!
